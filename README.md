Rock Paper Scissors Assignment in JS

### Part 2 - DOM Manipulation ###
Create 3 Buttons, Rock, Paper, and Scissors. //done
add an event that calls playround function

add a div for displaying results //done
display the running score and announce the winner of the game at 5 points


1.)Start with a page that says
"Can you outsmart me in Rock, Paper, Scissors?"
-> maybe some css that transitions between can you.. and ..rock

2.)Create a button that says "Start game", when it does, delete the button, and create a flexbox with 3 buttons //done

3.) add a running tally that keeps track, maybe a reset function?

### JS Reflection ###
This was definitely an adventure. JS handles much, much differently than I was expecting compared to Python, and certain quirks were much more difficult to accept than I initially thought. I really wanted to add a replay button function (maybe I will come back and do it later), but for now, I'm satisfied with completing the assignment.

CSS reflection will be added when I finish.

Things to improve upon in the future:

1.) I really want to learn how to add an empty div element into the document body. I couldn't quite figure out how to make it work without starting with empty divs preloaded into the HTML. Maybe that is just a quirk of JS that can't be changed?

2.) Adding user input with eventListener functionality is vastly different from what I'm used to doing in Python, it really challenged the way I thought about coding. I'm curious if it would be possible to make some sort of for loop with user input, but it seems somewhat lackluster.

3.) I'm quite disappointed I was unable to figure out how to get the results of the game and make a single "gameCleanup()" function to clean up the game and display the winner all within a single function (or at least, I wanted to only have to write one function for the result). However, I just couldn't figure out a way to get the results. My solution is definitely not very elegant, even if it works.


### CSS REFLECTION ###
I feel more comfortable with CSS now, it seems. I was thinking about adding some animation transitions, etc. but I started to get caught up in design brainfog and decided that it's just better to move on for now so that I don't end up spending endless amounts of time on something because I can't decide what design I like. If/when I revisit the project, I'll look into adding more animations with the text, swapping the buttons to images, etc.
